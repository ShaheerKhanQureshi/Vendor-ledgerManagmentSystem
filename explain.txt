Absolutely! Let's walk through each of the **Vendor** and **Ledger** controller functions to understand their workings and the functionalities they currently provide.

### **1. Vendor Controller**

The **Vendor Controller** handles the operations related to managing vendors. The operations include **creating**, **updating**, **deleting**, and **retrieving** vendors. The main functionalities are:

#### a. **Create Vendor (`createVendor`)**

- **Functionality**: This function is responsible for creating a new vendor in the database. It receives the vendor's information from the request body (like company name, supplier name, contact number, and bank details) and inserts the data into the `vendors` table.

- **Steps**:
  1. Validates the fields (company name, supplier name, contact number, bank details) to ensure they are non-empty and are strings.
  2. Checks if a vendor with the same company name already exists in the database.
  3. If the vendor exists, it returns a 400 error with a message saying the vendor already exists.
  4. If no vendor exists, it inserts the new vendor record into the `vendors` table.
  5. Creates a new entry in the **Ledger** table with default values when a new vendor is created, and the `vendor_name` is set to the newly created vendor's company name.

- **Return**:
  - On success: A 201 status with a message that the vendor was created successfully, along with the `vendorId`.
  - On failure: A 400 or 500 status with a relevant error message.

#### b. **Update Vendor (`updateVendor`)**

- **Functionality**: This function updates the details of an existing vendor in the database. It allows you to update fields such as company name, supplier name, contact number, and bank details.

- **Steps**:
  1. Validates that the vendor ID (`id`) is valid.
  2. Validates the input fields (company name, supplier name, contact number, and bank details).
  3. Checks if the vendor exists in the database using the provided `id`.
  4. If the vendor is found, it updates the vendor's details in the `vendors` table.
  5. Updates the **Ledger** entry by updating the `vendor_name` column in the **Ledger** table to reflect the new vendor's name.

- **Return**:
  - On success: A 200 status with a message that the vendor was updated successfully.
  - On failure: A 400 status if the vendor ID is invalid, or a 404 if the vendor does not exist.

#### c. **Delete Vendor (`deleteVendor`)**

- **Functionality**: This function is used to delete a vendor from the database.

- **Steps**:
  1. Validates the provided vendor ID (`id`).
  2. Checks if the vendor exists in the `vendors` table.
  3. If the vendor exists, it deletes the vendor record from the `vendors` table.
  4. The vendor's associated **Ledger** entry is also deleted to maintain data consistency.

- **Return**:
  - On success: A 200 status with a message indicating that the vendor was deleted successfully.
  - On failure: A 400 status for invalid IDs, or a 404 if the vendor was not found.

#### d. **Get All Vendors (`getAllVendors`)**

- **Functionality**: This function retrieves all the vendors from the database.

- **Steps**:
  1. Executes a query to get all vendors from the `vendors` table.
  2. It also retrieves the vendor data with an added `s_no` (serial number) that uses SQL's `ROW_NUMBER()` function to give each row a serial number.
  3. Returns the list of all vendors.

- **Return**:
  - On success: A 200 status with a list of all vendors.
  - On failure: A 500 status with an error message.

### **2. Ledger Controller**

The **Ledger Controller** handles the operations related to maintaining the ledger entries for vendors. These ledger entries track financial transactions and are linked to a specific vendor.

#### a. **Create Ledger Entry (`createLedger`)**

- **Functionality**: This function is used to create a new ledger entry in the database when a transaction is made with a vendor.

- **Steps**:
  1. Validates the input fields (vendor name, date, challan number, description, debit, credit, payment method).
  2. Ensures that the `vendor_name` field is provided.
  3. Inserts the new ledger entry into the `ledger` table, recording the transaction details such as debit, credit, and vendor name.
  4. Initially, the debit and credit amounts are calculated based on the transaction.

- **Return**:
  - On success: A 201 status with a message indicating the ledger entry was successfully created.
  - On failure: A 400 status for missing or invalid fields.

#### b. **Update Ledger Entry (`updateLedger`)**

- **Functionality**: This function is used to update an existing ledger entry for a particular vendor.

- **Steps**:
  1. Validates the ledger ID (`id`) to ensure it's valid.
  2. Validates the input fields for updating the ledger (date, challan number, description, debit, credit, payment method).
  3. Checks if the ledger entry exists in the `ledger` table using the provided ID.
  4. If the entry exists, updates the ledger entry with the new details.
  5. Also ensures that the **vendor name** is updated in the ledger if the vendor's information is updated.

- **Return**:
  - On success: A 200 status with a message indicating the ledger entry was successfully updated.
  - On failure: A 404 status if the ledger entry is not found.

#### c. **Delete Ledger Entry (`deleteLedger`)**

- **Functionality**: This function deletes an existing ledger entry from the database.

- **Steps**:
  1. Validates the ledger ID (`id`).
  2. Checks if the ledger entry exists in the database.
  3. If the ledger entry exists, it deletes the entry from the `ledger` table.

- **Return**:
  - On success: A 200 status with a message indicating that the ledger entry was successfully deleted.
  - On failure: A 404 status if the ledger entry is not found.

#### d. **Get All Ledgers for Vendor (`getAllLedgersForVendor`)**

- **Functionality**: This function retrieves all the ledger entries for a specific vendor.

- **Steps**:
  1. Accepts a vendor's name as a parameter to filter ledger entries by that vendor.
  2. Queries the `ledger` table for all entries that match the provided vendor name.
  3. Returns the list of all ledger entries for the specified vendor.

- **Return**:
  - On success: A 200 status with the list of ledger entries for the specified vendor.
  - On failure: A 404 status if no ledger entries are found for the given vendor name.

#### e. **Get All Ledgers (`getAllLedgers`)**

- **Functionality**: This function retrieves all ledger entries, typically to get an overview of all transactions.

- **Steps**:
  1. Retrieves all entries from the `ledger` table.
  2. This can be useful for auditing, reporting, or generating financial statements.

- **Return**:
  - On success: A 200 status with the list of all ledger entries.
  - On failure: A 500 status with an error message.
